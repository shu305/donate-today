                <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                <p class="package-descript-text">
                    As more people have been flood affected, shortage of drinking water and food has become acute.
                    Different water-borne diseases have spread among the flood victims.

                    Government relief has yet to reach the flood affected areas. A number of local NGOs and some charity
                    organizations are conducting limited-scale relief activities. But it is very inadequate for the
                    victims.

                <p class="package-descript-text">
                    Needs for shelter and settlements are increasing. The number of internally displaced people across
                    the globe reached 55 million by the end of 2020, with 40.5 million new displacements, the highest
                    annual figure recorded in a decade.

                <h3>Education for a family</h3>
                <p class="package-descript-text">
                    Education brings self-discipline, a sense of responsibility, team-work among children and prevents
                    them from feeling social insecurity. It helps in being self-confident and a good decision-maker.
                    Hence, every child must be educated so that they can lead a happy life.
