                    <p class="package-descript-text">
                        As more people have been flood affected, shortage of drinking water and food has become acute.
                        Different water-borne diseases have spread among the flood victims.

                        Government relief has yet to reach the flood affected areas. A number of local NGOs and some
                        charity
                        organizations are conducting limited-scale relief activities. But it is very inadequate for the
                        victims.

                    <p class="package-descript-text">
                        Needs for shelter and settlements are increasing. The number of internally displaced people
                        across
                        the globe reached 55 million by the end of 2020, with 40.5 million new displacements, the
                        highest
                        annual figure recorded in a decade.

                    <p class="package-descript-text">
                        Education brings self-discipline, a sense of responsibility, team-work among children and
                        prevents
                        them from feeling social insecurity. It helps in being self-confident and a good decision-maker.
                        Hence, every child must be educated so that they can lead a happy life.

            <p> Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply
                rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they
                believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.</p>
